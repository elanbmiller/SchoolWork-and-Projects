## Assignment Questions

1. Solve the following bitwise and boolean operations, assuming they are written in C and the numbers are `int`s.

	a. 0 || 23 == 1
	b. 0 | 23 == 10111
	c. 5 && 0 == 0
	d. 5 & 3 == 101
	e. !4 == 0
	f. ~5 == 010
	g. 7 >> 3 == 00000000 etc.
	h. 3 ^ 5 == 110

3. Explain in a couple of sentences the advantages of breaking your program into multiple files and using header files to declare functions.It lets the compiler know which function to look for and its structure and it allocates memory for the function
