## Assignment Questions

In a few sentences, what does PWM do, on a physical level? Can the Arduino 
actually output a voltage that is not 0 or 5 Volts?
The pwm changes the width of the output pulses, which turns the volts on high
or low and creates a steady light between 0 and 5 volts depending on the time 
the value of output is high versus low. 
The Arduino can only output voltage that is approximately 0 or 5 volts.


In a few sentences, how does your program convert the input from `analogRead` 
into a voltage? Could you generalize this into an equation to get a voltage
given an `analogRead`?

It stores the value from analogRead, which takes in the analogPin number (0), in an int val,
which it scales to a number between 0 and 255.
Then, it tests val to see what value the potentiometer is at, and it scales 
certain colors up and down based on that.
Then, using analogWrite, the values for the colors are used to make the lights appear on the led

We know that volts from 0-5 correspond with the number 0-1023
Therefore, if we know the analogRead value, and we can see that there are 
.00488 volts per integer value, we can simply multiply the analogRead value 
by .00488 to determine the volts


Why do you have to put resistors on the circuit?

The high value of voltage is too big for the LED, and the resistors scale it back so the LED
is not damaged
