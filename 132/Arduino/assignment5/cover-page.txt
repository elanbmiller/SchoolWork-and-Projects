## Assignment Questions

What is the Morse code encoding of the message "Hello world"?
{1, 1, 1, 1, 0},{1, 0, 0, 0, 0},{1, 3, 1, 1, 0},{1, 3, 1, 1, 0},{3, 3, 3, 0, 0}  - {1, 3, 3, 0, 0},{3, 3, 3, 0, 0},{1, 3, 1, 0, 0},{1, 3, 1, 1, 0},{3, 1, 1, 0, 0}
We said in the writeup that we "cheated" on the normal rules for .h files
and .c files.  What could you do (don't actually do it, just describe it)
so that your morse sketch follows the rules strictly (i.e., no actual
executable code in a .h file)?

.h is simply a header file, and header files have the program definitions and the source files contain the program.

The .h file should be converted to a .c file to be "correct"
