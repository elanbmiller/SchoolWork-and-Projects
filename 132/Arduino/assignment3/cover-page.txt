## Assignment Questions

Dolbear's Law is an equation that gives you a temperature from a number of
cricket chirps in one minute. What is the equation that provides the chirp 
period given a temperature in Celcius?
Seconds Per Chirp = (1.0 / (( (7.0*temp)/60.0 - 0.5)))

Using the datasheet for your temperature sensor, the equation you derived
from it, and you knowledge of the Arduino, what is the expected `analogRead()`
value for 25 Celcius? 15 Celcius? Include any assumptions, like 
`analogReference()`, and a little bit of your work (an equation is fine).

We know there's a 750 mV output at 25 Celcius, and working backwards, we know that
V = analogRead() * 1.1/1023 and we know the amount of volts is 0.75, therefore the analogRead
value is 697.5 for 25 Celsius

Likewise at 15 Celsius, the voltage is .01*(15)+.5 = .65 V, 
and 1023*.65/1.1 = 604.5, which is the analogRead() value 


What temperature range is the TMP36 specified for? How accurate is it in this
range? This can be answered looking solely at the overview and specifications
pages.

-40 - 125 Celsius.
Accuracy : +/- 2 Celsius
